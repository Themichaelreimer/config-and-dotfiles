# Config and Dotfiles
This repo exists because I like my qtile and kitty configs and want to easily work on them across multiple machines

# File locations / Setup

- Clone this repo into `~/.config/`, and that will get you 90% of the way there already
- Install the requirements in requirements file
- Copy qtile.desktop to `/usr/share/xessions/`

# TODO
- Track down the missing requirements, because many packages were figured out before I intended to throw this on github
- Sort out better monitor detection and screen handling. It's a little janky on laptops that dock right now
